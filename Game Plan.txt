    2. React Hooks
    3. Redux
    4. react-redux
    5. SCSS

Prerequisites:

    - When a symbol is clicked, move to a different screen that plays out an animation to declare the winner
        1. What you picked on the left, blank circle on the right
        2. what the house picked appears on the right
        3. Who wins is highlighted, space added between your choice and the houses, and the result is diplayed inbetween with a play again button
    - Button to display the rules
        - Rules pops up in the center of the screen with an 'X' button to make it disappear again
            - On mobile, it takes up the entire screen
        - When rules are diplayed, the rest of the app is darkened
    - Score is tracked
        - If you win, score goes up by one
        - If you lose, score goes down by one
        - If you refresh the page, score does not reset
